# Notes

## Outline:
Create working concept of a Traffic Management Center (TMC) sending traffic control messages to Road-side Units (RSU's) which relay the messages to vehicle On-board Units (OBU's).

Control (TMC) -> Road Infrastructure (RSU) -> Cars (OBU)

## Overall To Do:
- Figure out hardware
    - TMC := NVIDIA Jetson Nano
    - RSU := Rasberry Pi
    - OBU := Rasberry Pi
- Figure out communication
    - (TMC -> RSU) := ethernet
    - (RSU -> OBU) := internet
        - Must emulate DSRC communication
        - Need to follow DSRC standards
- Messages should result in control limits for the cars 
    - ie. capping speed in simulated construction zone
    - start with [CAV in a box](https://github.com/usdot-fhwa-stol/cav-education/tree/develop/cav_box/faust/models)?

## Next To Do:
- Get Jetson up and running
    - Need microSD with bootable image. Downloaded prebuilt image from NVIDIA and found a microSD, but not sure if being reserved for something else
- Need forms to get Raspberry Pi and NVIDIA software
- Need way to r/w to micro sd
